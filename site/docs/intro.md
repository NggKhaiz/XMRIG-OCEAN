# What ZMRIG is

ZMRIG is a complete Monero mining setup, not a collection of scripts:

| Part | What it is | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Miner** | XMRig 6.26.0 with every line of donation code removed, plus a complete Zig miner on the same RandomX engine | **0 %**, and that claim is checkable |
| **Installer** | `oneclick.sh`: one flag, host tuning, systemd unit, self-check, purge | free |
| **Proxy** | one pool connection for a farm: extranonce per rig, per-rig difficulty, tunnels | free |
| **Pool** | self-hosted Monero pool: stratum over TCP and WebSocket, PPLNS, every share verified | 1 % of each block, nothing else |

The miner works with any pool. The 1 % on the pool in this repository is what
keeps the project running; the miner itself takes nothing either way, and there
is no account, token or telemetry anywhere in it.

## Three decisions that shape everything else

**The fee is provable, so it is checked.** `sudo ./oneclick.sh verify` greps the
binary for the upstream donation endpoints and known wallets, then runs hash
self-tests so that "it found nothing" cannot mean "it looked at the wrong file".
See [the zero-fee page](/docs/reference/zero-fee).

**There are no flags to start.** `--wallet` is the only required input. The
installer reads the CPU, the RAM, the hypervisor and the battery, then picks the
engine, the thread count, the huge-page strategy and the governor, and prints
the reason for each choice before it acts. `./oneclick.sh plan` shows every
decision and changes nothing.

**A miner that is not earning should say so.** A rig whose pool rejects every
share looks perfectly healthy from outside. `zmrig` judges its own numbers once
a second and exits so the supervisor restarts it — twenty seconds of lost
hashrate instead of a night of zero.

## Requirements

- Linux x86-64 (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora, Arch; the script detects the distro).
  macOS and Windows can build the C++ engine, but the installer targets Linux.
- 2 GB of free RAM for `fast` mode, or `--mode light` with about 300 MB.
- `systemd` if you want it as a service.
- root, for huge pages, MSR and the service.
- A network connection for the first build. Everything is compiled on the
  machine; no binary is downloaded from anywhere.

## Where the code came from

Nothing here was written from scratch, and the parts that were not are credited
in the repository's `NOTICE` file:
