# Ocean Pool

A Monero (RandomX) mining pool in about 5 000 lines of dependency-free
JavaScript. It speaks classic stratum over TCP and stratum over WebSocket, which
is what makes it usable from the many VPS providers that only allow outbound
443. Every share is re-hashed by the pool before it is paid, and every block is
written to an append-only audit log.

It is small enough to read in an afternoon and it runs on a 1 vCPU box next to
`monerod`.

## The fee, in one table

| What                 | Value                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pool fee             | **1.0 %**, taken from each block reward, rounded *down* |
| Hidden fees          | none                                                   |
| Where it goes        | published at `/api/config` and on the status page       |
| Miner-side dev fee   | 0 % (`zmrig` has none, and the pool is GPL-3.0)         |
| Payout threshold     | 0.01 XMR, paid in the network fee                       |

The fee is deducted from the block reward before the PPLNS split, never from a
miner's balance afterwards. If a block reward does not divide evenly, the
leftover piconero is listed as `dust` in the audit record instead of being
quietly added to the fee.

Why 1 %: it is in line with the established Monero pools (0.6 – 1 %), and it has
to cover the one thing those pools do not do — re-hashing every submitted share
on the operator's CPU. A pool that skips verification can afford 0.6 %; a pool
that pays for work nobody did is not cheaper, it is just subsidised by its
honest miners.

## Requirements

* **Node.js ≥ 18.17** — no `npm install`, there are no dependencies.
* **A Monero node** (`monerod`) with JSON-RPC reachable, ideally on the same
  machine or the same private network.
* **`zmrig` on `PATH`** for share verification (`verify_shares: true`). Build it
  from this repository:

  ```bash
  ZIG=/path/to/zig ./zmrig/build.sh --jobs 2
  sudo install -m 0755 zmrig/out/zmrig /usr/local/bin/zmrig
  ```

  Without it, the pool logs `cannot start the verifier` and drops shares rather
  than trusting them. Set `"verify_shares": false` only on a private test pool.

## Five-minute start

```bash
# 1. a node you own (testnet is fine while you set things up)
monerod --data-dir ~/.bitmonero --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --confirm-external-bind

# 2. the pool
cd pool
node src/index.js --check --config config.json     # validates and exits
node src/index.js --config config.json            # serves stratum + HTTP

# 3. a miner, in another terminal
zmrig -o 127.0.0.1:3333 -u YOUR_MONERO_ADDRESS.rig1 -t 4
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` for the status page. `curl -s
127.0.0.1:8080/api/stats | jq` gives the same numbers as JSON.

## Configuration

`config.json` is read first; environment variables win over it, which is how you
inject settings on a host that only gives you a dashboard. `config.example.json`
is the annotated starting point.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fee_percent` | `1.0` | Published fee, 0 – 10. |
| `operator_address` | built-in | Where the fee goes. Empty means the built-in address in `src/operator.js`. |
| `port` | `3333` | Stratum over TCP. Set equal to `http_port` to disable TCP entirely. |
| `http_port` | `8080` | Status page, JSON API, `/metrics`, WebSocket stratum. |
| `ws_path` | `/stratum` | WebSocket endpoint, e.g. `wss://pool.example/stratum`. |
| `daemon` | `http://127.0.0.1:18081` | `monerod` JSON-RPC. |
| `mode` | `monerod` | `synthetic` generates deterministic test jobs with no daemon. |
| `initial_difficulty` | `2000` | First difficulty a new miner gets. |
| `target_share_seconds` | `15` | Vardiff target. |
| `min_difficulty` / `max_difficulty` | `100` / `4e6` | Vardiff clamp. |
| `verify_shares` | `true` | Re-hash every share with `zmrig --verify-share`. |
| `pplns_window` | `3600` | Seconds of shares that split a block. |
| `payout_min` | `0.010000000000` | Minimum balance before a payout. |
| `payout_mode` | `ledger` | `ledger` records balances, `wallet` really pays. |
| `wallet_rpc` | `http://127.0.0.1:18083` | `monero-wallet-rpc` for `wallet` mode. |
| `reserve` | `0.05` | XMR kept in the hot wallet for network fees. |
| `state_file` / `audit_file` | `./data/…` | Ledger state and append-only audit log. |

Environment names are the upper-case equivalents: `POOL_FEE_PERCENT`,
`OPERATOR_ADDRESS`, `PORT`, `HTTP_PORT`, `DAEMON`, `POOL_MODE`,
`VERIFY_SHARES`, `PPLNS_WINDOW`, `PAYOUT_MODE`, `WALLET_RPC`,
`INITIAL_DIFFICULTY`, `VARDIFF`, `STATE_FILE`, `AUDIT_FILE`, `LOG_LEVEL`, and
the rest of the table above.

`--check` prints the effective configuration and exits non-zero on anything that
would let the pool take a fee it cannot justify (fee out of range, unknown mode,
a PPLNS window so short that payouts are a lottery, a non-Monero operator
address in `wallet` mode).

## Shares, PPLNS and the audit log

* A share is accepted only if the pool's own `zmrig --verify-share` produces the
  same hash the miner submitted. A wrong hash is not just rejected: the
  connection is closed, because there is no legitimate reason to send one.
* Share weight is *difficulty × time*, not share count, so a miner on a slow
  connection is not punished and a miner splitting work across rigs is not
  rewarded twice.
* When a block is found, the reward is split over the last `pplns_window`
  seconds of shares. The fee is taken first, rounded down; every miner payment
  and the dust are written to `audit.jsonl`:

  ```json
  {"event":"block","height":3456789,"hash":"…","reward":"600000000000",
   "fee":"6000000000","dust":"0","distributed":[{"address":"4…","atomic":"…","weight":"…"}]}
  ```

`GET /api/audit?limit=20` returns the same records, newest first.

## Payouts

`ledger` mode (default) computes what everyone is owed and sends nothing — the
right choice while you test, and still auditable. Switch to `wallet` mode once
`monero-wallet-rpc` holds the block rewards:

```bash
monero-wallet-rpc --rpc-bind-port 18083 --disable-rpc-login \
  --wallet-file pool-wallet --password-file wallet.pass
```

Safety rules in `src/wallet.js`: one transfer per address per round, largest
first; never more than the ledger says is pending; stop the round on the first
RPC error instead of leaving a half-paid state; keep `reserve` in the hot wallet
so the pool can always pay the network fee.

## Running it for free

The pool is a single process with no database and no build step, so every free
tier that can hold a long-lived connection works. Check the terms of the host you
pick; free tiers change.

### Render (free web service, WebSocket only)

Render gives you HTTPS/WSS on one port and no raw TCP. That is exactly the case
the WebSocket stratum exists for.

1. Push this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. New → Web Service → Docker, or "Node" with
   * Build command: *(empty)*
   * Start command: `node pool/src/index.js --config pool/config.json`
3. Environment:

   ```
   PORT=8080            # Render's port must be used for both listeners
   HTTP_PORT=8080
   DAEMON=https://your-monerod:18081
   POOL_FEE_PERCENT=1
   ```
4. Miners connect with `zmrig -o wss://your-service.onrender.com/stratum …`.

`render.yaml` in the repository root is a ready blueprint.

Caveat worth knowing: the free instance sleeps after 15 minutes without
traffic, and a sleeping pool earns nothing. For a pool that is meant to be a
business, the $7 instance (or a Fly.io machine) pays for itself with one block.

### Fly.io (raw TCP and WS)

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy --dockerfile deploy/Dockerfile
fly volumes create pool_data --size 1
fly secrets set DAEMON=https://node.example:18081
fly deploy
```

`fly.toml` in the repository root maps `3333/tcp` (stratum), `8080/tcp` (HTTP/WS) and mounts the
volume at `/data` so the ledger survives restarts. `monerod` does not fit in the
free 256 MB machines — point `DAEMON` at a node you run elsewhere.

### Cloudflare Workers (for miners behind a restrictive network)

`pool/worker/` is a stateless WebSocket ⇄ TCP bridge. A miner that can only make
outbound HTTPS connects to `wss://<worker>/stratum`; the Worker opens a TCP
socket from Cloudflare's edge to your pool and copies bytes both ways. No Durable
Object, no storage, so it fits the free Workers plan.

```bash
cd pool/worker
npx wrangler deploy --var POOL_HOST:pool.example.com --var POOL_PORT:3333
```

Then: `zmrig -o wss://ocean-pool.<account>.workers.dev/stratum -u …`.

### Vercel

Vercel cannot hold a stratum connection: functions are request/response and are
reaped, and there is no raw TCP listener. Host the *status site* there if you
like, and run the pool where a socket can stay open (Render, Fly, a VPS). The
pool's HTTP API is ordinary JSON, so a static page on Vercel can render it.

## HTTP API

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | Status page (HTML, no JS required). |
| `GET /healthz` | `{ok, height}`; 503 until a template exists. |
| `GET /api/stats` | Pool counters, ledger totals, published config. |
| `GET /api/config` | Fee, operator address, PPLNS window, payout minimum. |
| `GET /api/audit?limit=20` | Block records: reward, fee, per-miner split, dust. |
| `GET /api/worker/:address` | Balance, shares and last-seen for one address. |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text format. |
| `WS /stratum` | Stratum over WebSocket (`login`, `submit`, `keepalived`, `getjob`). |

Everything is read-only; `POST` and friends get `405`.

## Deployment files

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `deploy/Dockerfile` | Builds `zmrig`, then a slim runtime: non-root, healthcheck. |
| `../render.yaml` | Render blueprint: Docker, one port, ledger on disk. |
| `../fly.toml` | Fly.io: TCP 3333 + HTTP 8080, volume at `/data`. |
| `worker/` | Cloudflare Worker WS ⇄ TCP bridge (`wrangler deploy`). |

## Tests

```bash
cd pool
npm test          # 27 tests: unit, protocol, and end-to-end with a real miner
```

The end-to-end file starts a real pool, mines with `zmrig` over TCP **and** over
WebSocket, and then submits a forged all-zero hash over TCP to prove it is
rejected and nothing is credited. It skips itself if `zmrig` is not built.

## Operating notes

* **One operator, one address.** There is no account system and no database.
  The ledger is a JSON file plus a BigInt map.
* **Keep `state_file` on a volume.** On Render/Fly that means a disk mount;
  without it a restart forgets who is owed what.
* **`/metrics` is cheap.** Point Prometheus at it, or a 30-second cron and a
  spreadsheet.
* **The audit log is append-only.** Rotate it with `logrotate`, never rewrite it;
  miners check their own numbers against it.
* **A pool with zero miners makes zero money.** The fee is only as good as the
  hashrate behind it; the miner side of this repository (`zmrig`) is where the
  users come from, which is why it has no developer fee of its own.
