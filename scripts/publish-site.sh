# Build the documentation site and put it in both places GitHub Pages reads.
#
# This repository has two Pages deployments pointing at the same URL, and which
# one finishes last decides what a visitor sees:
#
#   * "Deploy site" (.github/workflows/pages.yml) uploads `web/` as an artifact.
#   * "pages build and deployment" is GitHub's own build of the branch root,
#     because Settings → Pages → Source is still "Deploy from a branch".
#
# Neither can be changed without the `workflows`/Pages permission this tooling
# does not have, so both trees are generated from one build and `tests/docs/
# pages.sh` fails if they ever disagree. Once the Source is switched to "GitHub
# Actions", the root copy can go — see doc/SETUP.md §4a.
#
# `web/` is replaced whole; the root copy replaces only the paths Docusaurus
# owns, so nothing a human wrote in the repository root can be lost.
#
#   ./scripts/publish-site.sh            build and publish
#   ./scripts/publish-site.sh --check    fail if either copy is stale
