# governor.sh - the one host setting where the two profiles must differ.
#
# `free` pins the CPU to its top frequency: the governor never has to ramp, so
# work never starts at a low clock. `watt` does the opposite -- power grows with
# V^2 * f, and a mining thread stalled on memory does not need the top bin -- so
# it leaves a power-aware governor alone and only repairs the one setting that
# actively wastes power (`performance`).
#
# The script reads sysfs at absolute paths, so it takes CPU_ROOT and
# POWER_SUPPLY_ROOT overrides. This test builds a fake tree and checks that the
# right file got the right value -- the alternative is trusting shell logic that
# nobody ever ran.
