ZMRIG is a complete Monero mining setup, not a loose collection of scripts:

| Part | What it is | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Miner** — `src/`, `zmrig/`, `oneclick.sh` | XMRig `6.26.0` fork with every line of donation code removed, plus a complete Zig miner on the same RandomX engine | **0 %**, forever, provable |
| **Proxy** — `proxy/` | One pool connection for a farm: extranonce per rig, per-rig difficulty, tunnels for rigs in another building | free |
| **Pool** — `pool/`, `worker/`, `deploy/` | Self-hosted Monero pool: stratum over TCP and WebSocket, PPLNS, every share re-hashed before it is paid | 1 % of each block, and nothing else |
| **Site** — `web/` | Install wizard, command builder, fleet calculator, and the documentation | free to host |

Point the miner at any pool. If you point it at the pool in this repository,
the 1 % fee is what keeps the project alive; the miner itself takes nothing
from you either way, and there is no account, no token and no telemetry
anywhere in it.

## What makes it different

Most miners ask you to trust a percentage. This one is built so the percentage
can be checked, and so the things that quietly cost money are handled where
they happen:

1. **No developer fee, and a way to prove it.** The donation strategy, its
   wallet and its endpoint are gone from the source and the binary.
   `sudo ./oneclick.sh verify` greps the binary for the upstream endpoints and
   wallets and prints what it found. [`doc/ZERO_FEE.md`](doc/ZERO_FEE.md).
2. **Zero flags to start.** `--wallet <address>` is the only required input: the
   installer detects the CPU, the RAM, the hypervisor and the battery, then picks
   the engine, the thread count, the huge-page strategy and the CPU governor,
   and prints the reason for each choice before it acts.
3. **It tells you when it stops earning.** A miner whose pool rejects every
   share looks perfectly healthy from outside. `zmrig` judges its own numbers
   once a second and exits so the supervisor can restart it — 20 seconds of
   lost hashrate instead of a night of zero.
4. **A refusal is a decision, not a retry loop.** A banned IP, a wrong wallet,
   a rate limit: each is classified, each gets its own cooldown per pool, and
   reconnects are jittered so a rack of rebooting rigs does not arrive in the
   same millisecond. This is the difference between one bad evening and a
   permanent block.
5. **One command that can be undone.** `purge --dry-run` lists every path the
   tool created, with sizes, before anything is deleted, and a test asserts it
   never touches a file it did not make.

## Install in one command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NggKhaiz/ZMRIG/BETA/oneclick.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --wallet 4YourMoneroAddress...
```

That is the whole install. It fetches the sources, builds for this CPU, tunes
the host (huge pages, THP, governor, MSR), measures the machine to find the best
thread count, writes a systemd unit, proves the 0 % fee and prints live stats.
Re-running is safe: an existing config is never overwritten without `--force`.

Do not want to remember flags? The **[wizard](https://nggkhaiz.github.io/ZMRIG/wizard.html)**
asks for the wallet, the pool and the network of the machine, and prints exactly
this command — plus a `plan` variant that resolves everything and changes
nothing. The wizard and the home-page builder are generated by one function
from one pool table, and `web/tests/pools.test.js` fails if that table ever
disagrees with `oneclick.sh` or the documentation.

See every automatic decision and its reason without touching the machine:

```bash
./oneclick.sh plan
```

## Prove the 0 % fee

```bash
sudo ./oneclick.sh verify
```

```
==> verifying zmrig
    OK  PASS rx/0 reference vector
    OK  PASS pipelined hashing
    OK  PASS full-memory dataset matches the cache
    OK  no donation endpoints or wallets: 0% developer fee
    OK  verified
```

The check greps the binary for `donate.v2.xmrig.com`, `xmrig.com/donate` and
every wallet the upstream forks are known to use, then runs hash self-tests so
"it found nothing" cannot mean "it looked at the wrong file". `donate-level` and
`donate-over-proxy` are still accepted so existing scripts keep working, then
ignored with a log line.

## Everyday commands

```bash
sudo ./oneclick.sh status            # service, hashrate, shares, health
sudo ./oneclick.sh bench             # 180 s RandomX measurement
sudo ./oneclick.sh report --power 95 # ZMRIG1. code for the fleet calculator
sudo ./oneclick.sh update            # git pull, rebuild, restart
sudo ./oneclick.sh tune              # re-run host tuning + thread search
sudo ./oneclick.sh logs              # journalctl, last 200 lines
```

From the miner itself:

```bash
zmrig --self-test                    # hash vectors, benchmark, memory pre-flight
zmrig --bench=20000                  # fixed hash count, same seed every time
zmrig --report --power 95            # prints ZMRIG1.<base64url> in ~15 s
zmrig --autotune=8                   # measure thread counts; no pool needed
zmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10001 -u 4YourAddress.rig1 -a auto
```

## Pools, and not getting banned

Fees are a percentage; an IP that cannot connect is 100 % of the income. Both
are handled, in that order.

| Pool | Fee | Min payout | Endpoint | Why |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| **MoneroOcean** | 0 % | 0.003 XMR | `gulf.moneroocean.stream:10001` | pays the best RandomX coin per hash, pays out in XMR |
| SupportXMR | 0.6 % | 0.1 XMR | `pool.supportxmr.com:3333` | largest pool, lowest variance |
| C3Pool | 0 % | 0.003 XMR | `c3pool.com:3333` | 0 %, no switching, different infrastructure |
| HeroMiners | 0.9 % | 0.01 XMR | `monero.herominers.com:10191` | smallest payout threshold |
| xmrpool.eu | 0.9 % | 0.07 XMR | `xmrpool.eu:3333` · `:443` TLS | 443-only networks; strictest ban policy |
| P2Pool mini / nano | 0 % | ~0.0004 XMR | `pool.xmr.pub:3333` · `:3334` | no pool owner, block-by-block payouts |

```bash
sudo ./oneclick.sh install --wallet 4YourAddress... \
  --pool=moneroocean --failover=supportxmr,c3pool
```

Short names resolve to the right host, port and TLS mode; `--failover` writes
backup pools into `config.json`, used only when the first is unreachable or
refuses this IP. What the miner refuses to do, because each of these is how an
IP gets banned:

* retry a **wrong wallet** every five seconds — it identifies the refusal, leaves
  that pool alone for 30 minutes and prints the fix;
* reconnect immediately after `your IP is banned` — 15 minutes per pool
  (`--ban-cooldown`), then the next one;
* keep submitting once the pool has called three shares **invalid** — a
  10-minute pause instead of the hour-long ban `xmrpool.eu` hands out;
* let twenty rebooting rigs reconnect in the same millisecond — every retry is
  jittered ±20 %.

The usual reason a rig stops is not a pool ban but DNS filtering: Quad9 returns
NXDOMAIN for `gulf.moneroocean.stream`, Cloudflare's malware resolver does the
same for `pool.supportxmr.com`. A backup pool on another domain, a regional
hostname, TLS on 443 or `--connect-to` gets past it. Sources and the full
table: [`doc/POOLS.md`](doc/POOLS.md).

### Networks that only allow 443

```bash
# WebSocket + TLS on 443, the shape that survives HTTPS-only egress and CDNs
sudo ./oneclick.sh install --wallet 4YourAddress... \
  --pool pool.example.com --cloudflare --ws-path /stratum

# or a proxy the host already has
zmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10001 -u 4YourAddress.rig1 \
  --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:9050
```

`--connect-to` dials an IP while keeping the hostname for SNI and `Host`, for
the case where DNS is poisoned but the route works. Details:
[`doc/NETWORK.md`](doc/NETWORK.md).

## Farms: one connection

A farm loses money in three ways that never appear in a miner log: two rigs
computing the same nonce, one difficulty that starves the smallest machine, and
a login storm that gets the public IP rate-limited.

```bash
sudo ./proxy/install.sh --user=<wallet> --pool=gulf.moneroocean.stream:10001
```

* **one upstream connection**, one login at the pool, for up to 255 rigs;
* **one nonce byte per rig**, so no two machines can find the same share — the
  byte order is unit-tested because getting it wrong looks healthy from outside;
* **per-rig difficulty**, ~15 s between shares whether the rig does 500 H/s or
  20 kH/s;
* **rigs survive the pool dying**: sockets stay open, the last job is replayed,
  a pool that refuses the login is left behind immediately;
* **one flag for the network**: `--tunnel=wireguard` (fixed `10.66.66.x`, UDP, no
  third party), `tailscale`, `cf`, `cf-quick`;
* **H/s and XMR/day per rig** in `/status`, measured from accepted shares, and
  `null` when the network difficulty is unknown rather than guessed.

60 tests, including real sockets and a WebSocket rig. Tunnel comparison and the
WireGuard recipe: [`doc/PROXY.md`](doc/PROXY.md).

## Self-hosted pool

* **Stratum over TCP and WebSocket** — the second one is what makes a miner work
  on a host that only allows outbound 443.
* **Every share verified** — the pool re-hashes each submitted blob with
  `zmrig --verify-share`; a hash that does not match closes the connection
  instead of being paid.
* **PPLNS in BigInt piconero** — no floating point near money, fee rounded down,
  dust listed instead of absorbed.
* **Auditable** — `/api/audit` and `audit.jsonl` carry the reward, the fee and
  every miner payment for every block.
* **No dependencies** — `node pool/src/index.js`, no `npm install`, no database.
* **Free to host** — one process, one port; Render for WSS, Fly.io for raw TCP,
  a Cloudflare Worker in front when rigs are behind a restrictive network.

```bash
cd pool
node src/index.js --check --config config.json   # validate and exit
node src/index.js --config config.json           # stratum + HTTP
npm test                                         # 29 tests, includes a real miner
```

Fees from a reference deployment go to the wallet in
[`doc/DONATE.md`](doc/DONATE.md); your own instance pays your own wallet.

## Performance

Measured on a 2 vCPU Xeon at 2.6 GHz, 3.9 GiB RAM, `rx/0`, mode `fast`. Absolute
hashrate on shared vCPU moves with the host (20–25 % between sessions on the
same box), so the ratios are the useful part.

| Configuration | Hashrate | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| tuned install (huge pages reserved by the miner, MSR, affinity) | **1070 H/s** | 100 % |
| stock defaults, nothing reserved (what a fresh VPS does) | 856 H/s | 80 % |
| `--no-huge-pages` | 634 H/s | 59 % |
| `-t 1` (one thread on two vCPUs) | 553 H/s | 52 % |
| `--mode light` (256 MiB cache, for tiny VPS) | 76 H/s | 7 % |
| `--no-jit` (interpreter only) | ~180 H/s | never for mining |

Everything else that was tried — scratchpad prefetch modes, `--no-affinity`,
`--no-optimized-init`, VAES-512 — landed inside noise or worse, and is
documented as such instead of being sold as a speed-up. The full table, the
method and the commands: [`doc/BENCHMARKS.md`](doc/BENCHMARKS.md) and
[`doc/PERFORMANCE.md`](doc/PERFORMANCE.md).

**Worth more than any rewrite:** huge pages (the miner reserves them itself),
MSR on bare metal, one thread per physical core, and a governor that does not
downclock. `./oneclick.sh install` does all four.

## Repository layout

```

zmrig/                 the Zig miner (build.sh, src/, tests/, capi/ bindings)
src/                   the C++ miner (XMRig 6.26.0, donation code removed)
proxy/                 one pool connection for a farm (node, no dependencies)

## Tests

Ten suites, no mocks where a socket will do. Run them all:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake nodejs python3   # once
./zmrig/build.sh --jobs 2
cd web && npm install --no-save jsdom && cd ..
npm run test:web && npm run test:pool && npm run test:oneclick
npm run test:docs && npm run test:pages
cd proxy && npm test
cd .. && ./zmrig/tests/unit.sh && ./zmrig/tests/cli.sh && ./zmrig/tests/health.sh
./zmrig/tests/net.sh --soak
```

| Suite | Assertions | What it proves |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `web` `node --test tests/` | 57 | wizard and builder produce the same command, pool table matches `oneclick.sh`, no duplicate ids, every link resolves |
| `proxy` `npm test` | 60 | extranonce allocation, vardiff, real sockets, WebSocket rig, banned pool left alone |
| `pool` `npm test` | 29 | PPLNS in BigInt, share verification, payouts, audit log, end-to-end with a real miner |
| `zmrig/tests/unit.sh` | 16 modules | options, hashing, health, report codes, stratum parsing, proxy handshakes |
| `zmrig/tests/cli.sh` | 40 | flags, exit codes, `--help` covers the parser |
| `zmrig/tests/net.sh` | 29 | TCP/TLS/WS/WSS against a fake pool, ban and refusal handling, failover, seed change |
| `zmrig/tests/health.sh` | 7 | the watchdog, both directions: an honest pool is not a fault, an all-reject pool is |
| `tests/oneclick/*.sh` | 56 | plan, config, governor, purge (removes only its own paths), branch switching |
| `tests/docs/links.sh` | 52 | every relative link and every `#anchor` in the documentation resolves |
| `tests/docs/pages.sh` | 20 | the site survives the way GitHub Pages serves it: entry point, branch-root redirect, no root-absolute links, every `href`/`src` and `#anchor`, CSP meta, titles, sitemap, workflow |

## Branches and releases

```
ALPHA  ──►  BETA  ──►  master
newest      default      history + tags
work        (install)
```

| Branch | What it is | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`BETA`** | default branch, the released state | every command in this README already uses it |
| `ALPHA` | the next release, may break | `MINER_BRANCH=ALPHA sudo -E ./oneclick.sh install --wallet …` |
| `master` | upstream history plus merge commits, tagged per release | reference only |

`oneclick.sh` is the only place that hard-codes a branch, and
`web/tests/branches.test.js` fails if any link, one-liner or default points
somewhere else — the installer once pointed at a short-lived branch and `update`
failed silently, which is exactly the class of bug a test should own.

**Where the numbers come from.** Every hashrate in this repository was measured
with `zmrig/tests/ab.sh` or `zmrig --bench` on the same 2 vCPU Xeon host, one
configuration per run, dataset built before the timer starts; the raw tables and
the exact commands are in [`doc/BENCHMARKS.md`](doc/BENCHMARKS.md). Where a
measurement landed inside noise, it says so instead of becoming a selling point.

**Where the pool data comes from.** Fees, minimum payouts and port lists were
read from each pool's own pages and public stats (`cryptunit`, `xmr.pub`, the
`xmrpool.eu` FAQ) in **October 2026**, and are dated in
[`doc/POOLS.md`](doc/POOLS.md). DNS-blocking reports come from the resolvers'
own blocklists. These numbers change; the file says when it was checked so you
can tell how stale it is.

## Support

The miner has no fee, so the honest answer to "how do I support this?" is: you
do not have to. If you still want to, there is exactly one address:

<p align="center">
  <img src="doc/donate/monero.png" width="190" alt="QR code for the Monero address 46SQLW7D…n6ysb5tJ">
</p>

```text
46SQLW7DXaq6GJaQbHUFMAhd1VYpfQFJQ2gfZo9TCB8bf9vnf1MUwAD2Fwj6KMsY4RU3oKA3x6hByg8BKg7FfMWn6ysb5tJ
```

Monero (XMR), mainnet, 95 characters, network byte `18`, base58 checksum valid.
It is the same wallet the pool's 1 % fee is paid to, so a thank-you and a fee
payment land in one place with one audit trail; the verification recipe is in
[`doc/DONATE.md`](doc/DONATE.md). No flag, config key or service reads this
address — `./oneclick.sh verify` still reports 0 % with it sitting in this file.

**Worth more than money:** mine through the pool, send a before/after
measurement, or open an issue with the command, the full output and the
hardware. Addresses in forks, issues, videos or direct messages are not mine;
only the one above is.
